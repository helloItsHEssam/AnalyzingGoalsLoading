# Analyzing Goals Loading <img alt="Logo" src="/icon.png" align="right" height="50">

I crafted this project during my SwiftUI animation learning path, exploring the use of ```animation```, ```spritekit particle``` and ```Morphing(blob) shape``` .

## Inspiration 💡

The main idea of this source code based on [Loading](https://dribbble.com/shots/18701721-Loading) created by [DΞNYS S.](https://dribbble.com/sergushkindotcom).

## Screenshots 🌃
